### Offline visualization of midi notes

Okay, enough weird things. So I am doing this because I couldn't find a good midi visualizer for MacOS except MidiTrail. The problem is, I don't want 3D visualization. I just want to see my midi notes fall. Not more. Anyway, here is the to-do:

#### Necessary:
[x] Reading midi file
[x] Fixing tempo changes
[ ] Visualizing keyboard 
[ ] Visualizing notes
[ ] Making this an actual video

#### Will be good if it is there:
[ ] Writing tempo, duration, key signature, etc.
[ ] Adding background
[ ] Making better visuals
[ ] Adding background music
