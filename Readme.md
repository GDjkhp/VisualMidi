### Offline visualization of midi notes

Also, before you begin, if you are searching for efficient midi player, this is not it. Trust me. 

Okay, enough weird things. So I am doing this because I couldn't find a good midi visualizer for MacOS except MidiTrail. The problem is, I don't want 3D visualization. I just want to see my midi notes fall. Not more. Anyway, here is the to-do:

#### Necessary:
- [x] Reading midi file  
- [x] Fixing tempo changes  
- [x] Visualizing keyboard  
- [x] Visualizing notes  
- [x] Making this an actual video  

#### Will be good if it is there:
- [x] Writing tempo, duration, key signature, etc.  
- [ ] Adding background  
- [ ] Making better visuals  
- [x] Adding background music  
- [x] Config file
